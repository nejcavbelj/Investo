## üîß Setting Environment Variables in Railway

1. Open your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your deployed service
3. Go to the **Variables** tab
4. Click **+ New Variable**
5. Add each environment variable (name and value)
6. Railway will automatically redeploy with the new variables

---

## ‚úÖ Verify Setup

After setting the environment variables:

1. Visit your Railway URL
2. Go to `/status` endpoint (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app/status`)
3. Check that all required environment variables show as "set"
4. Check the Railway deployment logs to see initialization status

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Analysis system is initializing" message
- **Cause**: Missing environment variables
- **Solution**: Check `/status` endpoint and add missing variables

### Report generator not available
- **Cause**: Import error or missing dependencies
- **Solution**: Check Railway logs for detailed error traceback

### Railway healthcheck failing
- **Cause**: App not binding to correct host/port
- **Solution**: Already fixed! App now binds to `0.0.0.0` and uses Railway's PORT

### Feedback form shows "Not Found" error
- **Cause**: Feedback blueprint not registered in app.py
- **Solution**: Already fixed! Feedback handler is now registered on startup

### Feedback form doesn't send email
- **Cause**: Missing `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` environment variable
- **Solution**: Set up Gmail App Password and add to Railway variables

## üìä Testing Your Setup

1. Go to your Railway URL (e.g., `https://investo-production.up.railway.app`)
2. Enter a stock ticker (e.g., AAPL, TSLA, MSFT)
3. Click "Analyze Stock"
4. You should see a comprehensive report with:
   - Benjamin Graham value analysis
   - Peter Lynch growth analysis
   - Reddit sentiment analysis
   - Combined investment verdict

## üí° Notes

- The free Finnhub tier is sufficient for personal use
- OpenAI costs are minimal (~$0.01-0.05 per analysis)
- Reddit API is completely free
- All API keys should be kept secret - never commit them to Git
