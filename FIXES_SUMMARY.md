# Investo Report Generator - Issue Fixes

## Problem Solved
The original issue was a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'` that occurred when trying to analyze TSLA, causing infinite report generation that blocked your PC.

## Root Cause
The error was in the `generate_combined_verdict` function where boolean values could be `None`, and Python couldn't sum `None` values with integers.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed TypeError in Combined Verdict Generation
**File**: `reports/combined_report_generator.py`
**Problem**: Line 131 was trying to sum boolean values that could be `None`
**Solution**: Added proper type checking and conversion to integers:

```python
# Convert to integers to avoid NoneType errors
positive_signals = sum([
    int(graham_pass) if graham_pass is not None else 0,
    int(lynch_good) if lynch_good is not None else 0,
    int(reddit_positive) if reddit_positive is not None else 0
])
```

### 2. Added Safety Mechanisms
**File**: `reports/combined_report_generator.py`
- Added file existence check before writing
- Added error handling for browser opening
- Added unique timestamp to prevent filename conflicts

### 3. Added Report Limit Protection
**File**: `interactive_main.py`
- Added maximum report counter (5 reports per session)
- Added session tracking to prevent infinite loops
- Added user feedback on report count

### 4. Created Cleanup Utility
**File**: `cleanup_reports.py`
- Script to clean old reports
- Prevents disk space issues
- Safe cleanup with confirmation prompts

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED**: TSLA analysis now works without errors
✅ **SAFE**: Only one report generated per run
✅ **PROTECTED**: Maximum 5 reports per session
✅ **CLEAN**: Old infinite reports cleaned up

## Usage
- **Quick test**: `python main.py` (analyzes TSLA)
- **Interactive**: `python interactive_main.py` (menu-driven)
- **Cleanup**: `python cleanup_reports.py` (remove old reports)

## Test Results
The system now successfully generates reports for TSLA and other tickers without the TypeError or infinite loop issues. Each run creates exactly one report file with a unique timestamp.
