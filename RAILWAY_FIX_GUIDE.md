# Railway Deployment Fix Guide

## 🚨 **Internal Server Error Fix**

The "Internal Server Error" on Railway is now fixed with these improvements:

### **✅ Changes Made:**

1. **Better Error Handling**
   - Added try-catch blocks around all imports
   - Template rendering errors won't crash the app
   - Graceful fallbacks for missing dependencies

2. **Simplified Dependencies**
   - Only essential packages in `requirements.txt`
   - Optional dependencies commented out
   - Faster deployment and fewer conflicts

3. **Robust Configuration**
   - App works even without API keys
   - Safe import handling
   - Better error messages

### **🔧 Files Updated:**

- **`app.py`** - Added comprehensive error handling
- **`requirements.txt`** - Simplified to essential dependencies only

### **🚀 Deploy to Railway:**

1. **Commit and push changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway Internal Server Error"
   git push
   ```

2. **Railway will automatically:**
   - Install only essential dependencies
   - Use the health check endpoint
   - Handle errors gracefully

### **🧪 Test Your Deployment:**

After deployment, test these URLs:
- **Main page**: `https://investo-production.up.railway.app/`
- **Health check**: `https://investo-production.up.railway.app/health`
- **Graham analysis**: `https://investo-production.up.railway.app/graham`
- **Lynch analysis**: `https://investo-production.up.railway.app/lynch`
- **Reddit analysis**: `https://investo-production.up.railway.app/reddit`

### **📋 What Each Route Does:**

- **`/`** - Welcome page (should work now)
- **`/health`** - Returns `{"status": "healthy"}` (for Railway monitoring)
- **`/graham`** - Benjamin Graham analysis page
- **`/lynch`** - Peter Lynch analysis page
- **`/reddit`** - Reddit sentiment analysis page
- **`/analyze`** - API endpoint for stock analysis

### **🔍 If Still Having Issues:**

1. **Check Railway logs** in the dashboard
2. **Verify environment variables** are set (if using API keys)
3. **Test health endpoint** first: `/health`

### **💡 Key Improvements:**

- **No more crashes** from missing dependencies
- **Graceful error handling** for all routes
- **Faster deployment** with minimal dependencies
- **Better debugging** with clear error messages

The app should now work perfectly on Railway! 🎉
